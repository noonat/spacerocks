This is a little multiplayer game where you can fly around and shoot rocks in
space. It may remind you just a little bit of another such game made in the
late 70s. Maybe.

When I was leaving one of my previous jobs a couple years ago, I made this game
after my friends at work kept asking when I was leaving. I was very sad to be
leaving, and needed something a little cathartic. And what's more cathartic
than trolling? The game had a countdown clock until 5pm on my last day, and the
number of players slowly grew as 00:00:00 grew closer. When the clock finally
expired, the game redirected the players to [a video that I thought everyone
would enjoy][video], and the office was filled with its soothing tones.


## Running the game

You can play by visiting https://spacerocks.herokuapp.com/, but if you want
to run the app locally, just clone the repo, run `npm install`, and then run
`npm start`. Open http://127.0.0.1:8080 and you should see happy little space
rocks floating aimlessly across your screen, blissfully unaware of their
immediate peril.
